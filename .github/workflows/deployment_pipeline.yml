            The build process has failed. Please check the GitHub Actions logs for more details.
            This could be due to:
            • Frontend build errors (Vite/React compilation)
            • Backend test failures (unit/integration tests)
            • Frontend test failures (Vitest/React Testing Library)
            • E2E test failures (individual: login, blog, blog-2 or sequential fallback)
            • ESLint linting issues (backend/frontend)
            • Dependency installation problems
            • Race conditions in E2E tests
            • MongoDB connection issues
